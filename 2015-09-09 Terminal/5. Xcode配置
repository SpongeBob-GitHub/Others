比如[ Alcatraz ]：
Installation

Through Alcatraz

Download the sources, build the project and restart Xcode

Download SCXcodeMinimap.xcplugin.zip from the releases tab, unzip and move it to the Xcode plugins folder ~/Library/Application Support/Developer/Shared/Xcode/Plug-ins/SCXcodeMinimap.xcplugin

If you encounter any issues you can uninstall it by removing the ~/Library/Application Support/Developer/Shared/Xcode/Plug-ins/SCXcodeMinimap.xcplugin folder

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

演示、全过程

1> Installation（ 安装 ）

To install, open up your terminal and paste this:

curl -fsSL https://raw.github.com/supermarin/Alcatraz/master/Scripts/install.sh | sh
or download the repository from Github and build it in Xcode. You'll need to restart Xcode after the installation. 

Alcatraz requires Xcode Command Line Tools, which can be installed in Xcode via Preferences > Downloads



2>Troubleshooting（ 解决问题 ）

If "nothing" happens when installing packages, try the following self-help steps:

Verify which copy (if more than one are installed) of git is being run (which git).
Make sure you're running a recent version of git (git --version).
If you've used Xcode developer preview releases in the past, make certain Xcode isn't stuck using an inappropriate developer path by resetting it (sudo xcode-select --reset).

3> Uninstall（ 卸载 ）

Open up your terminal and paste this: 

$ rm -rf ~/Library/Application\ Support/Developer/Shared/Xcode/Plug-ins/Alcatraz.xcplugin
To remove all packages installed via Alcatraz, run 

$ rm -rf ~/Library/Application\ Support/Alcatraz/
